# wordle
A two-player version of the web-based game Wordle. 
Allows one user to set a five-letter word to guess and the number of guesses that a second player will get to figure out the chosen word.
It runs through the terminal as console output. 

The original game can be accessed here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html 

The program employs a checkWord function that both the answer and the guess submitted by the second player are passed through to compare the two strings. 
This function employs escape sequences to dynamically change the color of the text that is outputted to the console as needed.
